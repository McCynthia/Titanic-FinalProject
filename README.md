# Titanic-FinalProject

## Overview
This project involves building machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models are trained on a preprocessed dataset, and their performances are evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- imbalanced-learn
You can install the required packages using pip: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn`
